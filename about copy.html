       <p>In 1980 I was looking for a relaxing weekend getaway at a yurts resort for my wife and I. I then realized that there was nothing out there that offered what I was looking for, so I decided to open Pacific Trails Resort. I started small with only two yurts and have now grown to ten yurts while still providing our guest the privacy of a small resort.

       Pacific Trails Resort offers an experience for everyone over our 100 acre resort. Enjoy one of our ten unique yurts and hiking through our miles of trails. After a long day of hiking, bird watching or kayaking enjoy a relaxing evening in our heated pool or enjoy a sunset dinner.
